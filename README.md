# Chat Application

This is a full-stack chat application built using React, Vite, Express, and ChatEngine. The application allows users to engage in real-time chat with each other.

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React and Vite. It utilizes the `react-chat-engine-pretty` library for the chat functionality. The frontend folder contains all the necessary files for the client-side of the application.

### Setup

To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
4. In the `frontend` folder, locate the `chatspage.jsx` file and update the `projectID` variable with your generated project ID from the ChatEngine site.

### Running the Frontend

Once you have set up the project and updated the `projectID` variable, you can run the frontend using the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Backend

The backend of the application is built using Express and CORS. It serves as the server-side to handle user authentication and communication with the ChatEngine API.

### Setup

To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
3. In the `backend` folder, locate the `index.jsx` file and update the `privateKey` variable with your generated private key from the ChatEngine site.

### Running the Backend

Once you have set up the backend and updated the `privateKey` variable, you can run the server using the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This will start the backend server, and it will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## External API

The application uses an external API from "https://api.chatengine.io/users/" to handle user authentication and messaging.
